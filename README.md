# Terraria Fortress
Support me & this plugin's (along with several others) development on Ko.Fi: [Here!](https://ko-fi.com/averageterraria)

# **REQUIREMENTS**
These are required by this plugin to function correctly.
- SSC enabled! **Initial startup kit should be DELETED**
- Do not set pvp-mode to always, the plugin will handle this for you.
- An entire server for this to work on. (so either a dimensions setup, where this is a seperate server or... just run a standalone server for this? lolol)
- A world that would make sense for a gamemode like this... include two team spawn points (red and blue themed), a lobby (in the sky), a battlegrounds, 
- TShock V5, duh...

# Introduction & Implemented Stuff
This will be a Team Fortress 2-styled minigame plugin! This plugin was actually just started earlier today, and I've only pushed out the first commit but within (hopefully not too much time) time, I am planning a fully-working kit-based PVP game mode. My plugin will be themed around Team Fortress' characters and whatnot, such as the Scout, Sniper, etc. BUT- the way I'm developing this plugin, you could ideally use this plugin and completely change the gamemode, with your own loadouts/setups. Instead of taking on the TF2 style that I will be using in my server, you could make this into a more generic KitPvP type of situation. Right now, here are the plans for the plugin/what I've done so far:

- Loadouts
- Border regions
- Teams
- Leaderboard
- Match Instances
- Team spawnpoints

# Planned Features
- Control points (Maybe? Yeah probably...)
- Removing "sorter" region (if i can figure out a way lmao)
- Loadout-defined buffs
- A command for defining loadouts
- Possibly integrate block destruction and building? (resetting the map after each round and allowing tile placements)
- Leaderboard-type thing (shows winning team, top player(s), time left in round)
- DB-stored player stats (playtime, kill count, death count, etc.)
- Integrate a currency of some kind, potentially for ranking up (and unlocking other classes) (#fuck timeranks :>)
- Integrate CE item support (prob not but i'd like to)
- Integrate random events & disasters (mob boss spawns, meteor drops, acid rain, bombs fall from the sky)
- potential level system, which could maybe be a buildup of your character life? or defense... or ... idk something that doesn't completely throw off the balance (TBD)
- PvP check for an item that isn't in kits (kick this player, prob illegally spawned item)
- Integrate a team chat command /team <message>
- Clans integration - Clans for... some reason? Why the hell not lol
- Eventually.. my pre-defined config that i use for this server
- And much more to come...

I'm really excited because this is my biggest properly STANDALONE project, that I guess could be used by the public without issue? Or at least not too much issue... haha

Hopefully this helps some of you out there! My Discord is Average#1305 in case you need to submit any bug reports or feedback! Thank you :D
